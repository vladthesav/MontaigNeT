# MontaigNeT
MontaigNet (montaigne - net) is a machine learning web app that generates text in the style of 1500' French essayist Michel de Montaigne.

This application is powered by a PyTorch LSTM model trained on The Essays of Michel de Montaigne, which runs in a Flask REST API.

This web application (with a react frontend) takes a prompt from the user, feeds it into the API, and then displayes the generated text.
